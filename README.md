# CNN_MNIST_tensorflow
My project involves using TensorFlow to train a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. I designed and trained the neural network model using TensorFlow without Keras, relying solely on TensorFlow's low-level APIs. The model is trained using the gradient descent method to minimize the loss function and improve prediction accuracy on the test set.
I also integrated a graphical interface with Tkinter for real-time prediction. Users can draw digits, which are then converted into an image and passed to my model for digit prediction.
The project relies on TensorFlow for machine learning and Tkinter for the user interface
